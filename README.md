# WWRDBQR
WWRD QR Generator for PMIs

## Status
Currently, this is just an interface example. The current interface is generated with stock, immutable data. Coming soon is a version that will allow for the dynamic generation of the QR code.

## Installation
To run this app you need to have python 3.11 or greater and the following libraries installed:
- pillow
- qrcode
- tomlkit

## Future
This app is currently in alpha and is in active development. Future features include
- Dynamically generated P questions for PMIs
- Packaging as a platform executable for windows (and maybe other platforms)
- Build tool made from invoke
- API documentation using MKDocs and autodoc
- Tests using pytest and coverage
- Linting and code complexity metrics
- Build automation
